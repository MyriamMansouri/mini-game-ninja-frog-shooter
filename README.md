# Characterics

Ninja Frog is a mini shooting game in Vanilla JS created during Concordia Full Stack Bootcamp. Game engine and some basic classes were provided to us. Building on that, I created a whole new universe (new characters, game background, improved gameplay, responsiveness...). In particular, I added:
- start screen
- player can move across the screen on the horizontal and vertical axis
- player can catch bonuses
- player can fire ammunition
- animated ennemies, player, bonus and life images
- 3 lifes before game over
- music

I also made the game responsive. Game works (although it's less fun) on mobile as I added tap events and a specific gameplay.
